# Frequency-Counter
Frequency Counter pattern with several examples, and real world scenarios

- Can be implemented using Objects.
- Used to eliminate O(N2) time complexity on arrays, and strings.
- Rather than using nested loops, we can have separate loops that run upto the number of the input size.
- Mostly used in the real world to tackle problems like finding some array of data in another array of data. 
  This pattern is used to eliminate the use of nested or double for loops.
